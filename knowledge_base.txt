# FloraAgent Product & Occasion Guide

## Anniversary Flowers
For anniversaries, our most popular and recommended flowers are Red Roses and Lilies. Red Roses symbolize deep, romantic love and are a timeless classic. A bouquet of one dozen red roses is our best-seller. Lilies, especially Stargazer Lilies, represent devotion and partnership, making them a sophisticated choice. Our "Eternal Love" bouquet features a mix of both. Tulips are a great seasonal option in the spring.

## Birthday Flowers
Birthdays are a celebration of life, and our flower arrangements reflect that. Bright, colorful bouquets of Gerbera Daisies and Sunflowers are perfect for birthdays and convey joy and happiness. Our "Sunshine Bouquet" is a customer favorite. For a more elegant birthday gift, consider Orchids, which represent beauty and strength.

## Sympathy and Condolence Flowers
For expressing sympathy, it is best to choose arrangements that are subtle and comforting. White Lilies are the most traditional choice, symbolizing purity and the restored innocence of the soul. White Roses and Carnations are also appropriate, representing peace and remembrance. It is generally advised to avoid overly bright or celebratory colors. Our "Peaceful Memories" arrangement is specifically designed for these occasions.

## Flower Care Instructions
To maximize the life of your cut flowers, trim the stems at an angle under running water upon arrival. Remove any leaves that will be below the waterline. Use the provided flower food in a clean vase with fresh water. Change the water every two days. Keep flowers away from direct sunlight and ripening fruit.
